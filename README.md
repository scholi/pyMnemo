# pyMnemo
Small python GUI to mnemomize numbers (using Mnemonic major system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system)

For the moment the script uses an sqlite3 database for french words.
If you wish to use this script with an other language than french, please create your own database (you can share it with me so that I make it available for others).
